# Hardware
**[MacBookPro by Apple](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro)**  
**Operating System:** MacOS 
**Displays:** 13" Retina Display with True Tone (2560x1600) with [49" Ultra Wide](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-49-Inch-Curved-Monitor-LC49HG90DMNXZA/dp/B072C7TNC5) monitor by Samsung (3840x1080)  
**Processor:** 2.8GHz quad‑core 8th‑generation Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 4.7GHz  
**Storage:** 1TB SSD storage  
**Memory:** 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory  
**Keyboard:** [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english) by Apple  
**Mouse:** [Magic Mouse 2](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA02LL/A/magic-mouse-2-silver) by Apple  
**Extra:** [Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html#v=qc35_ii_silver) to use as wireless headphones and as a microphone. They are also noise cancelling which work great in office environments.   

**What I love about my hardware:** It's fast. Very fast. MacOS is very optimized.

**What I don't like:**  This is not my first Mac. In the past I have made the mistake (or benefit, depending on how you look at it) of integrating tightly with the Apple Ecosystem. This time, I am avoiding that by using Gmail, Messages for Web, Google Calendar and Keep instead of the native MacOS applications. Mac simply works better when you are using it's built in applications, however I am finding that these web applicatins are working amazingly as replacements and keeps me in the Google Ecosystem that I have previously invested in.

# Operating Systems
## MacOS  
MacOS is what you will have upon unboxing a MacBookPro, if you purchased in 2019, that will run Mojave. While I am finding that I really like Mojave, natively there are some applications that I use to make the experience even better. Below I outline the applications that I use day to day with Mojave.   

# Applications

## Productivity 
[Docs (ChromeOS)](http://docs.google.com) - Microsoft Word replacement.  
[Sheets (ChromeOS)](http://sheets.google.com) - Microsoft Excel replacement.  
Gmail (ChromeOS) - You've got mail.  
[Keep (ChromeOS)](http://keep.google.com) - A wonderful Note application I use with my family. Sharing is easy and it works with Google Home!  
[Hangouts (ChromeOS)](http://hangouts.google.com) - A great chat/ video/ screen sharing tool by Google.  
[Calendar (ChromeOS)](http://calendar.google.com) - With desktop notifications, this becomes very useful.  
[Trello (ChromeOS)](http://trello.com) - Story board application.  

## Code  
Terminal (Linux) - Terminal is your most useful app. Use it to install Java, Python, MySQL, etc.  
[IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (Linux)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - An amazing IDE that I use for my Java development.  
[Visual Studio Code (Linux)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Another amazing *light* code editor. Pairprogramming is made easy with the Share plugin.  
[MySQL-Workbench (Linux)](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) - Though you don't need a GUI for MySQL, I do like to have one in my local environment.  
[GitKraken (Linux)](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - Git made easy. I use this to share my code on Github.  
[AndroidStudio (Linux)](https://developer.android.com/studio/) - Standard Android development IDE.  
[Unity (Linux)](https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/) - I tested if Unity runs on my Pixelbook, for game development. It runs, however you may want to wait on GPU acceleration if you are going to use a chromebook for any serous game development.    

## Social  
Instagram (MacOS)  
[Twitter (MacOS)](http://twitter.com/iamtravisw)  
Facebook (MacOS)  
Reddit (MacOS)

## Music  
Spotify (Android)  
YouTube (ChromeOS)  
[Audacity (Linux)](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/linux/) - I use this for any sound editing I need to do.  

*Note that Crostini does not support audio yet. If you need to do heavy audio editing, you might want to wait for audio to officially be supported.*  

## Photos & Videos  
[Google Photos (ChromeOS)](http://photos.google.com)  
[GIMP (Linux)](https://www.gimp.org/) - Image editor, it's pretty popular and only second to Photoshop (in my humble opinion).  
[AutoDesk SketchBook (Android)](https://sketchbook.com/) - I use this for mocking up new ideas, designs and as a white board replacement.  
[Kdenlive (Linux)](https://kdenlive.org/en/) - Video Editor for Linux. Comparable to FinalCut Pro or Adobe Premiere.   

## Utilities  
[Calendar Clock (ChromeOS)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/calendar-clock/galgfocamdohgeifjlbefkfpaalankfi?hl=en)  
Google Drive (ChromeOS) - Works similarly to Microsoft Calendar/ Clock.  
WiFi (Android)  - I use Google's WiFi app to monitor my wifi occasionally, instead of SpeedTest.    
TEXT (ChromeOS) - This came with my ChromeOS. It's a simple text editor.  
[COG (ChromeOS)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cog-system-info-viewer/difcjdggkffcfgcfconafogflmmaadco?hl=en) - Display lots of useful hardware and network info such as CPU usage and temperatures.

## Browsers  
Chrome (MacOS) - Favorite browser, I use this 99% of the time.  
Safari (MacOS) - Only used for downloading Chrome.
Edge (Bootcamp) - Only used for downloading Chrome.
